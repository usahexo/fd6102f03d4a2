#  When Did Horseshoe Baltimore Casino Open?

The much anticipated Horseshoe Casino Baltimore finally opened on August 26, 2014. The casino is located on Russell Street in the city’s downtown area and has been in development for quite some time. The casino is a project of the Cordish Companies, which also developed the Live! Casino in Anne Arundel County.

One of the main reasons for the delay of the project was getting approval from the state gaming commission. There were also a few bumps in the road with regards to getting funding for the project. But, in the end, everything came together and the casino is now open for business.

The opening of Horseshoe Casino Baltimore was met with mixed reactions. There are those who are excited about it and those who are skeptical about it. There are concerns that the casino will bring an increase in crime to the area and that it will be a drain on city resources.

There are also concerns that the casino will have a negative impact on existing businesses in the area. But, there is also hope that the casino will bring new jobs and economic development to downtown Baltimore. Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley was among those who voiced support for the casino opening.

He said that it will create jobs and generate revenue for education and other important causes in Maryland. The Cordish Companies have also promised to donate $10 million to local charities over the next 10 years.
