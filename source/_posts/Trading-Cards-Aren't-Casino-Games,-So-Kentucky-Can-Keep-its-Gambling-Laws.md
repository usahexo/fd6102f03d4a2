#  Trading Cards Aren't Casino Games, So Kentucky Can Keep its Gambling Laws

The state of Kentucky is in the process of defending its gambling laws in court, after a group of retailers argued that trading cards should be considered casino games under the law. The retailers, who operate a number of businesses that sell and trade collectable cards, say that because players can win and lose money on the games, they should be classified as gambling activities.

But Kentucky's Attorney General says that's not the case. In a filing earlier this month, he argued that while trading cards may involve some risk and reward, they are not the same as casino games like poker or blackjack, which are designed specifically for gambling purposes. He also noted that there is no evidence that trading cards have ever been used for illegal gambling in the state.

The retailers aren't backing down, however. They argue that the law is too vague and doesn't clearly define what types of games are considered gambling. They also say that because playing cards are specifically mentioned in the law, trading cards must be considered gambling as well.

The case is scheduled to go to trial next year.

#  Wyoming Considers Classifying Trading Cards as a Type of Gambling

In Wyoming, a new bill is under consideration that would classify trading cards as a type of gambling. The bill, HB0070, was introduced by State Representative Tyler Lindholm and would make it illegal to trade cards for money or other goods and services.

The main purpose of the bill is to protect children from being exposed to gambling at a young age, but it could have a wide-reaching impact on the trading card community as a whole. If the bill is passed, it would be illegal to sell, trade, or gift trading cards in Wyoming.

 hobbyists and collectors who enjoy trading cards as a pastime could be impacted the most by this bill. Many traders do not engage in the activity for financial gain, but simply for the love of the game.

Some opponents of the bill argue that it's unnecessary, as there are already laws in place that prohibit minors from gambling. They also argue that trading cards are not technically gambling, as they can be traded for items other than goods and services.

Supporters of the bill say that it's important to protect children from any type of gambling and that trading cards should be included in the definition. They also argue that many minors do gamble with trading cards, so more regulation is needed.

The future of HB0070 is uncertain, but if it passes, Wyoming will become the first state in the country to classify trading cards as a type of gambling.

#  Trading Card Games Aren't Subject to Nevada's Gambling Laws

Some people might be under the impression that trading card games (TCGs) like Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! are gambling devices and, as a result, must adhere to Nevada's gambling regulations. This is not the case, however.

In order for an activity to be classified as gambling under Nevada law, it must meet three criteria: it must be a game or contest of chance, there must be something of value at stake, and the player must have an opportunity to win or lose money.

TCGs do not meet any of these criteria. First and foremost, they are not games of chance. Yes, there is some luck involved, but winners are determined by the skill of the player, not chance. Secondly, there is no money at stake - players can only win or lose cards, which have no real-world monetary value. Finally, there is no opportunity to win or lose money - players can only win or lose cards, which have no real-world monetary value.

As a result, trading card games cannot be classified as gambling devices under Nevada law and are not subject to its regulations.

#  Iowa Supreme Court Rules that Trading Cards are Not Considered Gambling

In a unanimous decision handed down on Thursday, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that trading cards — such as those depicting professional athletes — are not considered gambling. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by two men who were arrested in 2014 for allegedly engaging in illegal gambling after they were caught trading baseball cards.

The court held that “the mere fact that something is called ‘gambling’ does not make it so,” and ruled that the defendants’ conduct did not meet the legal definition of gambling. Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote in the opinion that, under Iowa law, gambling requires “an agreement to risk something of value upon the occurrence of an event whose outcome is uncertain.”

 Trading cards do not fit that description, Cady wrote, because the value of each card is not uncertain. He added that “the exchange of trading cards at issue here was nothing more than a mutually beneficial social transaction without any expectation of gain upon the outcome.”

The ruling is a victory for collectors and hobbyists who have long argued that trading cards should be considered a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. It also marks a defeat for law enforcement officials who have sought to crack down on card-trading as a form of illegal gambling.

#  Ohio Court Rules That Playing Trading Card Games is Not Gambling

On Monday, the Supreme Court of Ohio handed down a unanimous decision in the case of State v. Hand that declared that playing trading card games is not gambling. The case originated in 2015 when Ronald Hand was arrested and charged with two counts of gambling after he was caught playing Yu-Gi-Oh! with friends at a local restaurant.

The crux of the court's decision hinged on the definition of gambling. The justices ruled that in order for an activity to be considered gambling, there must be an element of chance involved. Since trading card games are played primarily through strategy and skill, they do not meet this requirement, and thus cannot be classified as gambling.

This ruling is a victory for fans of trading card games all across Ohio, who can now continue to enjoy these popular pastimes without fear of legal repercussions. It may also have broader implications for the legality of other tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons and Settlers of Catan.
