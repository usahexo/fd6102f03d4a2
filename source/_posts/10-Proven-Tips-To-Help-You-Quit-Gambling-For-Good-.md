#  10 Proven Tips To Help You Quit Gambling For Good 

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but for some people it can become a serious problem. If you’re finding that gambling is no longer fun, and is instead causing problems in your life, it might be time to quit. Here are 10 proven tips to help you quit gambling for good:

1. Be honest with yourself 
If you want to quit gambling, you first need to be honest with yourself about why you’re doing it. Are you trying to escape from reality? Are you bored? Are you stressed out? Once you know why you gamble, you can start addressing the underlying issues.

2. Set boundaries 
One of the best ways to stop gambling is to set boundaries for yourself. Decide how much money you’re going to allow yourself to spend on gambling each week, and then stick to it. If you find that you’re tempted to gamble more than what you’ve allowed yourself, put the money away or get rid of your bank cards so that it’s not accessible.

3. Avoid trigger situations 
If there are certain places or situations that make you want to gamble, try to avoid them. For example, if you tend to gamble when you’re out drinking with friends, try switching up your routine so that those situations no longer occur.

4. Deal with stress in healthy ways 
If you find that stress is a major factor in your gambling, find healthier ways to deal with it. Exercise, yoga, meditation and deep breathing exercises can all help to reduce stress levels and keep them under control.

5. Get help if needed 
If quitting gambling on your own doesn’t seem like it’s working, seek professional help. There are many therapists and counsellors who specialize in helping people overcome addiction problems.

6. Create a budget 
When quitting any addiction, one of the most important things is learning how to live within your means. Creating a budget is a great way to do this – when every penny has a purpose, it becomes easier not to waste money on unnecessary things like gambling.

7. Don't be ashamed 
Quitting any addiction can be difficult, but don't be ashamed of yourself – everyone falls off the wagon sometimes. What matters most is that you get back up and keep trying.

8. Make sure your loved ones are aware 
It’s important for your loved ones to be aware of what you’re going through so they can support you emotionally throughout the process of quitting gambling . Let them know what kind of triggers might cause a relapse so they can be prepared if it does happen .

 9 . Take things one day at a time   It's easy to get overwhelmed when trying to quit an addiction , but don't focus on the big picture – just take things one day at a time . incremental goals will help keep momentum going and make quitting less daunting .
