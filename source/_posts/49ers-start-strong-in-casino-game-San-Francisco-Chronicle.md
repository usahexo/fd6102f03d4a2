49ers start strong in casino game
The San Francisco 49ers started their preseason off with a bang on Saturday night. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo looked sharp, completing six of his seven pass attempts for 45 yards and a touchdown in just two drives. The 49ers defense was also impressive, holding the Texans to just three points while forcing two turnovers.

San Francisco's strong performance came as no surprise to many football fans. The team is coming into the season with high hopes after making some significant offseason acquisitions. The most notable of these acquisitions was quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who was acquired from the New England Patriots in exchange for a second-round draft pick.

Many people see Garoppolo as the answer to the 49ers' long-standing quarterback problems. He is expected to provide a much-needed upgrade at the position and help the team make a run for the playoffs this year.

While it's still too early to say for sure how well Garoppolo will perform, Saturday's game certainly gave fans reason to be optimistic. The 49ers are scheduled to play their next preseason game on August 18th against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The San Francisco 49ers rolled to an easy victory over the Oakland Raiders in a casino dice game Sunday.

Jimmy Garoppolo, who had been sidelined with a shoulder injury, started at quarterback and threw for three touchdowns in the first half to help the 49ers build a big lead. He finished with 344 yards passing.

"I was a little rusty in the beginning, but I got my groove back in the second half," Garoppolo said.

The 49ers' defense sacked Derek Carr four times and intercepted him once. The Raiders struggled to move the ball throughout the game, finishing with just 204 yards of total offense.

"We just didn't execute today," Carr said. "The 49ers are a good team and they made us look bad."

This was the first meeting between the two teams since Jon Gruden returned to coach Oakland. Gruden was fired by the 49ers after the 2001 season and has been seeking revenge against his former team ever since.

"I'm not happy about losing, but it feels pretty good to beat Oakland," Gruden said.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - The San Francisco 49ers have continued their winning streak in a casino dice game.

The Niners beat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, and they say the success is thanks to their practice at the craps table.

“We were confident coming in and knew what we had to do,” said quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. “We’ve been practicing all week and it paid off.”

Wide receiver Marquise Goodwin was especially pleased with the win. His father was a professional craps player, and Goodwin says he learned a lot from him.

“I think it helps a lot when you know what you’re doing and can put that into practice on the field,” said Goodwin. “It gives you an edge over your opponent.”

The Niners will look to continue their winning streak when they take on the Seattle Seahawks next week.
