<h1 id="How-to-win-at-blackjack-every-time-even-in-Bulgaria"><a href="#How-to-win-at-blackjack-every-time-even-in-Bulgaria" class="headerlink" title="How to win at blackjack every time - even in Bulgaria!"></a>How to win at blackjack every time - even in Bulgaria!</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, enjoyed by millions of people every day. It’s a game of skill and chance, and while there is an element of luck to it, if you follow a few simple tips you can increase your chances of winning significantly.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to teach you how to win at blackjack every time - even in Bulgaria! So whether you’re a complete beginner or a seasoned pro, read on for some essential advice that will help you take your game to the next level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the basics</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re new to blackjack, it’s important to learn the basic rules before you start playing. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points (a blackjack) or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
<p>Each player is dealt two cards at the beginning of the game, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is typically face down and one is face up. In order to win, your hand must be higher than the dealer’s hand without going over 21. If both hands are equal, it’s called a push and no one wins or loses money.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Play smart</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is not to go over 21. While it may be tempting to ‘double down’ on a strong hand in an attempt to win big, it’s important to remember that busting (going over 21) will result in an automatic loss. So always play smart - know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use basic strategy charts</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to give yourself the best chance of winning at blackjack, it’s worth using a basic strategy chart. This is a guide that tells you what move to make in any given situation, based on the point total of your hand and the dealer’s up card. You can find free basic strategy charts online, or buy them from most good bookstores.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Get practice<br>It’s always advisable to practice before playing for real money. Most online casinos offer free versions of their games so that you can hone your skills without risking any cash. There’s no substitute for experience when it comes to blackjack, so make sure you practice as much as possible before hitting the casino floor!</li>

It was supposedly developed in Bulgaria in the early 2000s, and since then it has been used successfully by players from all over the world.</p>
<p>The strategy is very simple and easy to learn, but it requires a lot of patience and practice to be able to use it flawlessly. Here is how it works:</p>
<h1 id="The-basic-principle"><a href="#The-basic-principle" class="headerlink" title="The basic principle"></a>The basic principle</h1><p>The basic principle of this blackjack strategy is to always split your cards when you have two identical ones. So, for example, if you have two eights, you should split them into two separate hands and play each one accordingly.</p>
<p>This may seem like a very risky move, but if done correctly it can actually increase your chances of winning significantly. By splitting your cards you are essentially doubling your chances of getting a good hand, which can make all the difference in a game of blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="When-to-split"><a href="#When-to-split" class="headerlink" title="When to split"></a>When to split</h1><p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to split your cards. Firstly, you should only do it if the dealer has an Ace showing – this is when splitting becomes most advantageous. Secondly, you need to make sure that you have enough money left to cover both hands properly.</p>
<p>If you decide to split your cards, always remember to play each one as if it were a completely separate hand. This means that you should not take any risks with your original hand – it should be played conservatively in order to ensure that you at least break even.</p>
<h1 id="The-benefits-of-splitting-your-cards"><a href="#The-benefits-of-splitting-your-cards" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of splitting your cards"></a>The benefits of splitting your cards</h1><p>There are several benefits of splitting your cards in blackjack:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You double your chances of getting a good hand.<br>“Two eights are better than one.”  - Unknown Author</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can win more money by taking advantage of favourable rules (e.g. double down on 9/10). * You can force the dealer to bust more often. * It makes the game more complicated for the dealer, which gives you an advantage.</p>
</li>

It’s a mixture of luck and skill, and it can be unpredictable - making it all the more exciting to play.</p>
<p>But if you’re new to the game, it can be confusing trying to figure out the best way to play. And if you’re playing in a casino in Bulgaria, things can be even more complicated, as the rules may be different from what you’re used to.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though - we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll give you all the information you need to know about how to beat blackjack. We’ll explain the basic rules of the game, teach you some basic strategy, and give you some tips on how to win big in a Bulgarian casino.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<p>What is blackjack?</p>
<p>Blackjack is a card game that is played between two players - or between a player and the dealer. The aim of the game is to score 21 points with your first two cards, or come as close as possible without going over 21. The player who scores 21 or closest to 21 wins the game.</p>
<p>In blackjack, each card has a value assigned to it:<br>2-10 = face value<br>Ace = 1 or 11 (depending on what is needed for achieving 21)<br>JACK, QUEEN, KING = 10 points each</p>
<p>The numbering of the cards is important when it comes to blackjack strategy - so make sure you remember them!</p>
<p>  In blackjack, each card has a value assigned to it:  2-10 = face value  Ace = 1 or 11 (depending on what is needed for achieving 21) JACK, QUEEN, KING = 10 points each The numbering of the cards is important when it comes to blackjack strategy - so make sure you remember them! How do I play blackjack?</p>
<p> Basic gameplay in blackjack is pretty simple:  each player is dealt two cards face up , and then has the option of either hitting (taking another card) or standing (not taking any more cards). The total value of these two cards is called your hand .  If your hand total equals 21 or less (not counting an Ace as either 1 or 11), then you have won! If your hand total exceeds 21 however (known as busting ), then you lose automatically .</p>
<p>  In blackjack, there are also various special hands that can be achieved : these are hands that are worth more than just their face value. Some of these include: Blackjack (an Ace and any 10-point card) - this pays out 3:2 , meaning that for every $5 wagered you would receive $7 back FLUSH (example: 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥) - pays out 7:1 STRAIGHT FLUSH (example: 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦) - pays out 50:1 FOUR OF A KIND (example: K♠ K♣ K♥ K♦) - pays out 25:1 FULL HOUSE (example: 3♠ 3♥ 3♣) - pays out 9:1 THREE OF A KIND (example: 5♣ 5♦ 5♥) - pays out 6:1 TWO PAIRS (example: Q♣ Q♥ J♠ J♦) - pays out 3:1 ONE PAIR(example: A♠ 2♦) - pays out 2:1 NONE OF THE ABOVE(for example 4♣ 4♥ 7♦ 8♠ 9♣) - pays out 1:1 Now that we’ve gone over the basics, let’s move on to some basic strategy tips… Basic Blackjack Strategy Tips When playing black jack basic strategy dictates that unless one of your first two cards is an ace OR there are already six decks remaining in shoe OR dealer stands at soft 17– always hit against dealer’s stiff totals(16 through ace). Double downagainst dealers ten through ace ONLY when your first two cards equal 10 or 11 . NEVER double down if dealer shows a deuce through six upcard since your probability of busting increases greatly.. ALWAYS split aces and eights IFthe casino allows splitting.. An eight should never be split against a dealer nine , ten , or ace because chances are good that another eight will come up onthe turn which givesthe player high probability 18-20 which most casinos will beat.(Exception being single deck games where player might get 22 against dealer’s ace.) Hit on any other Soft Totals(2 through 6 plus ace=soft tota l ) EXCEPTwhen dealer shows 4 ,5or 6 upcard.. Stand Against dealers Seven Through Ace.. Insuranceis only taken whendealer shows an Aceand</p>
