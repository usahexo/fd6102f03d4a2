        <h1 id="One-In-Four-American-Adults-Experience-A-Gambling-Problem"><a href="#One-In-Four-American-Adults-Experience-A-Gambling-Problem" class="headerlink" title="One In Four American Adults Experience A Gambling Problem"></a>One In Four American Adults Experience A Gambling Problem</h1><p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), “one in four American adults – or about 60 million people – experiences a gambling problem” at some point in their lives. While this condition may be widespread, it is also highly treatable.</p>
<p>Gambling disorders are a type of addiction that can cause severe harm to both the gambler and his or her loved ones. Symptoms can include chronic lying, indebtedness, stealing, and risky behavior. In addition to the personal toll, problem gambling also costs the United States billions of dollars each year in crime, health care, and other social costs.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, however, help is available. Treatment can involve counseling, medication, or a combination of both. With the right support, most people with gambling disorders are able to overcome them and resume healthy lives.</p>
<p>If you or someone you love is struggling with a gambling problem, please seek help. The NCPG website (ncpgambling.org) offers information on where to find assistance in your area.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Problems-Cost-U-S-Taxpayers-Millions"><a href="#Gambling-Problems-Cost-U-S-Taxpayers-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Problems Cost U.S. Taxpayers Millions"></a>Gambling Problems Cost U.S. Taxpayers Millions</h1><p>The Department of Justice has released a report that finds gambling problems cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in law enforcement and social service costs. The report, which was compiled by the department’s National Gambling Impact Study Commission, also finds that problem gambling rates are highest among Native Americans, who suffer from many social and economic ills.</p>
<p>According to the report, problem gambling costs state and federal governments $6.7 billion annually in law enforcement and social service expenses. In addition, the report finds that problem gambling is a major contributing factor to bankruptcy, crime, domestic violence, and child neglect.</p>
<p>The commission’s report makes several recommendations for addressing the negative impact of problem gambling, including increased funding for research on problem gambling and its prevention and treatment; increased funding for programs that address the social and economic problems caused by problem gambling; and increased regulation of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Members of Congress have already signaled their support for increased regulation of the gaming industry. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) has introduced legislation that would create a national commission to study the effects of gambling on public health and safety. And Representative Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ) has introduced legislation that would establish a fund to provide assistance to states with high rates of problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Americans-Lose-More-Money-Gambling-Than-They-Do-Buying-Lottery-Tickets"><a href="#Americans-Lose-More-Money-Gambling-Than-They-Do-Buying-Lottery-Tickets" class="headerlink" title="Americans Lose More Money Gambling Than They Do Buying Lottery Tickets"></a>Americans Lose More Money Gambling Than They Do Buying Lottery Tickets</h1><p>Americans gamble more money than they do buying lottery tickets.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the University of Las Vegas, Nevada, Americans lose an average of $220 per year on gambling activities, while they only lose $50 per year on lottery tickets.</p>
<p>The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that those who live in the Northeast are more likely to gamble than those who live in other regions of the country.</p>
<p>Gambling can take many different forms, including playing casino games, betting on sports, playing poker, and buying lottery tickets.</p>
<p>While some people view gambling as a fun way to pass the time, others see it as a way to make money. Unfortunately, the vast majority of gamblers end up losing money in the long run.</p>
<p>According to one study, 92% of all gamblers lose money in the long run. This is because the odds of winning are always against them.</p>
<p>While there are some occasional winners, most people who gamble eventually end up losing their money. This is why it’s important to be aware of the risks associated with gambling before you decide to participate in this activity.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Aren’t-More-Americans-Getting-Help-For-Their-Gambling-Problems"><a href="#Why-Aren’t-More-Americans-Getting-Help-For-Their-Gambling-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Why Aren’t More Americans Getting Help For Their Gambling Problems?"></a>Why Aren’t More Americans Getting Help For Their Gambling Problems?</h1><p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) released a study in May of 2017 that reported that only 2.7 percent of Americans who gamble problems are seeking help. This is startling when one considers that the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) estimates that 6 to 8 million Americans are affected by problem gambling. So why aren’t more people getting help?</p>
<p>There could be a number of reasons for this. One reason may be that people do not know where to find help for their gambling problems. The NCPG has a website with a searchable database of treatment providers, but not everyone may be aware of this website or know how to use it. Another reason may be that people are ashamed or embarrassed to seek help for their gambling problems. They may feel like they are the only person who has a problem and that they are weak or stupid for not being able to control their gambling.</p>
<p>Some people may also think that they can fix their own gambling problem without help. This often is not the case, as gambling addiction is a chronic disease that requires treatment. Treatment can involve individual counseling, group therapy, and medication management, among other things. Treatment can be expensive, but there are many options available for those who need it.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that so few Americans are getting help for their gambling problems, things seem to be getting better. The AGA’s study found that the number of people seeking help has increased by 50 percent since 2013. This is a positive sign, and hopefully more people will seek help in the future. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, please seek help. You are not alone, and there is support available for you.</p>
<h1 id="Half-Of-All-U-S-Gambling-Addicts-Are-Also-Alcoholics"><a href="#Half-Of-All-U-S-Gambling-Addicts-Are-Also-Alcoholics" class="headerlink" title="Half Of All U.S. Gambling Addicts Are Also Alcoholics"></a>Half Of All U.S. Gambling Addicts Are Also Alcoholics</h1><p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), half of all gambling addicts in the United States are also struggling with alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>This staggering statistic underscores the importance of dual diagnosis treatment for problem gamblers. If you are struggling with both gambling addiction and alcohol addiction, it is critical that you receive specialized treatment that addresses both issues simultaneously.</p>
<p>Why Are So Many Gamblers Addicted to Alcohol?</p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question. However, there are several possible explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some people may use alcohol to help them cope with the stress and anxiety associated with gambling addiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people may drink alcohol in order to increase their chances of winning at gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people may use alcohol as a way to celebrate wins or cover up losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people may turn to alcohol as a way to avoid reality and escape from their problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people may start drinking heavily after they develop a gambling addiction, as a way to self-medicate their symptoms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, many people who struggle with both gambling addiction and alcohol addiction find it difficult to get help. This is because most treatment programs focus on either addiction or mental health, but not both.</p>
<p>Dual diagnosis treatment programs, however, address both issues simultaneously, giving clients the best chance of recovery. These programs typically include individual therapy, group therapy, and psychoeducation classes. In addition, many dual diagnosis programs offer family counseling so that family members can learn how to support their loved one during recovery.</p>
