#  Game of Thrones Slot Machine Causes Huge Stir at Newcastle United FC 

One of the biggest clubs in English football, Newcastle United FC, made headlines this week when they announced they would be adding a Game of Thrones-themed slot machine to their stadium concourse.

The response from fans and the general public was mixed, with some praising the club for being innovative and keeping up with current trends, while others labelled it tacky and inappropriate.

Some people criticised the decision on the grounds that gambling addiction is a serious problem, and that having a casino-style slot machine at a football stadium could lead to vulnerable people spending too much money.

Others were simply not fans of the show, and felt that incorporating it into the stadium was a cheap way of trying to please more people.

However, club officials argue that the machine will be a big hit with fans of both Newcastle United and Game of Thrones, and that it will add an extra dimension to the matchday experience.

They also point out that all profits from the machine will be donated to charity, so there is no financial advantage to be gained by the club itself.

In the end, it will be up to individual fans to decide whether they want to use the machine or not – but it’s sure to be a talking point either way!
