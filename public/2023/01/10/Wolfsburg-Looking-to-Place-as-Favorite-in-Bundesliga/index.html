        <h1 id="Wolfsburg-Looking-to-Place-as-Favorite-in-Bundesliga"><a href="#Wolfsburg-Looking-to-Place-as-Favorite-in-Bundesliga" class="headerlink" title="Wolfsburg Looking to Place as Favorite in Bundesliga"></a>Wolfsburg Looking to Place as Favorite in Bundesliga</h1><p>The Bundesliga has been home to some of the most exciting soccer in the world and always provides a heated race for the top spot. This season, it looks as if Wolfsburg are set to take the top spot and make a serious playoff push.</p>
<p>Coming off of a disappointing finish last season that saw them knocked out of Europe and barely holding onto their place in the Bundesliga, Wolfsburg have come back this season hungry for success. They currently sit in first place in the Bundesliga table with an impressive 14 wins, 3 draws, and 2 losses. While teams like Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayer Leverkusen always provide stiff competition, it seems as if Wolfsburg are ready to take them on this year.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for their success this year has been their strong attacking play. Led by players like Andre Schurrle, Maximilian Arnold, and Bas Dost, they have been able to put up some impressive goal totals. They have also been very tough defensively, only allowing 21 goals so far this season. If they can continue to play at this level, they should be able to hold on to first place and make a serious playoff push.</p>
<h1 id="Wolfsburg-Looking-to-Repeat-as-Bundesliga-Champions"><a href="#Wolfsburg-Looking-to-Repeat-as-Bundesliga-Champions" class="headerlink" title="Wolfsburg Looking to Repeat as Bundesliga Champions"></a>Wolfsburg Looking to Repeat as Bundesliga Champions</h1><p>Wolfsburg enter the 2017-18 Bundesliga season as defending champions and are looking to repeat. They have been one of the most consistent teams in the league over the past few years, and this season should be no different.</p>
<p>One reason for Wolfsburg’s success is their strong midfield. Players such as Diego, Luiz Gustavo, and Julian Draxler are all very talented and capable of controlling the game. This will be crucial against sides like Bayern Munich, who are always a threat going forward.</p>
<p>Another key player for Wolfsburg is striker Mario Gomez. Gomez has been one of the most prolific strikers in Europe over the past few years, and he will be looking to score plenty of goals this season.</p>
<p>With a squad like this, Wolfsburg have a great chance of repeating as Bundesliga champions.</p>
<h1 id="Wolfsburg-Favored-to-Win-Bundesliga-Again-in-2017-2018"><a href="#Wolfsburg-Favored-to-Win-Bundesliga-Again-in-2017-2018" class="headerlink" title="Wolfsburg Favored to Win Bundesliga Again in 2017-2018"></a>Wolfsburg Favored to Win Bundesliga Again in 2017-2018</h1><p>The 2016-2017 Bundesliga season has come to a close, and it was a wild one. Bayern Munich, who had won the last five Bundesliga titles, finished runner-up. Meanwhile, upstart club RB Leipzig finished in third place. Now that the new season is about to begin, who will be the favorites to win the Bundesliga?</p>
<p>Wolfsburg are currently favored to win the Bundesliga, with Oddschecker listing them as 3/1 favorites. RB Leipzig are close behind at 5/2, while Bayern Munich are at 3/1 odds. Borussia Dortmund, who have finished in the top four for each of the past six seasons, are currently listed at 7/1 odds to win the Bundesliga this year.</p>
<p>What makes Wolfsburg such strong favorites? They have a very strong squad, headlined by star striker Mario Gomez. They also have a new manager in Bruno Labbadia, who led Hamburg SV from relegation contenders to European qualification in just two years.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig are also a strong team, thanks in part to their financial backing from energy drink company Red Bull. However, they may not be able to keep up with Wolfsburg over the course of an entire season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bayern Munich will be looking to get back on top after finishing second last season. Carlo Ancelotti is now in charge of Bayern and he is one of the most successful managers in world football. He will be looking to lead Bayern to their sixth consecutive Bundesliga title. However, they will have competition from RB Leipzig and Wolfsburg.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund had a disappointing season last year and they will be looking to make amends this year. New manager Peter Bosz is hoping to implement his trademark high-pressing style at Dortmund and lead them back to glory. Thomas Tuchel was let go after disagreements with management, so there is plenty of room for improvement at Dortmund this season.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting Bundesliga season with plenty of competition for the title. Wolfsburg are currently favored but anything can happen in football.</p>
<h1 id="RB-Leipzig-Racing-Ahead-in-the-Bundesliga-but-Wolfsburg-Still-a-Threat"><a href="#RB-Leipzig-Racing-Ahead-in-the-Bundesliga-but-Wolfsburg-Still-a-Threat" class="headerlink" title="RB Leipzig Racing Ahead in the Bundesliga, but Wolfsburg Still a Threat"></a>RB Leipzig Racing Ahead in the Bundesliga, but Wolfsburg Still a Threat</h1><p>With RB Leipzig currently cruising high in the Bundesliga table with 39 points from 18 games, it is looking increasingly likely that they will be crowned champions for the first time in their history. No one could have predicted this meteoric rise when they were promoted to the top flight in 2016, but Ralph Hasenhüttl has turned them into one of the most formidable teams in Europe.</p>
<p>However, they cannot afford to take their foot off the gas as fellow challengers Wolfsburg are still very much in the hunt. Die Wölfe have been inconsistent this season but have enough quality in their squad to upset any team on their day. They will need to start putting together some winning runs if they are to catch up with RB Leipzig though, and that could well start after the winter break.</p>
<p>One player who has shone for both clubs this season is midfielder and former Liverpool player Naby Keita. The 22-year-old has been instrumental in RB Leipzig’s charge to the top of the table, pulling the strings in midfield with his trademark driving runs forward. He is sure to be a key player for Guinea at this year’s African Cup of Nations, which begins next month.</p>
<p>Wolfsburg will be hoping that he doesn’t continue his current form if they are to stand any chance of catching up with RB Leipzig, as he already has six goals and six assists to his name this season. If Keita can maintain his current level of performance then it is likely that RB Leipzig will be lifting their first ever Bundesliga trophy at the end of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Wolfsburg-One-of-Favorites-Heading-into-Second-Half-of-Bundesliga-Season"><a href="#Wolfsburg-One-of-Favorites-Heading-into-Second-Half-of-Bundesliga-Season" class="headerlink" title="Wolfsburg One of Favorites Heading into Second Half of Bundesliga Season"></a>Wolfsburg One of Favorites Heading into Second Half of Bundesliga Season</h1><p>The Wolfsburg fans have reason to be excited as their Bundesliga season resumes after the winter break. They are in fifth place and only four points out of first.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that they lost their star player, Julian Draxler, in January. He was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>But the team has continued to play well, and there is good young talent on the squad. One of these players is attacking midfielder Joshua Guilavogui.</p>
<p>He has been with Wolfsburg since 2014 but has never really been able to break into the starting lineup. This changed when Draxler left.</p>
<p>Guilavogui has seized his opportunity and played very well in the last few months. He scored two goals in a recent match against Schalke 04.</p>
<p>This helped Wolfsburg win 3-0 and move up to fifth place in the Bundesliga table. Guilavogui is not the only player on the squad who has stepped up since Draxler’s departure.</p>
<p>Another player who has played very well is Belgian forward Divock Origi. He was loaned to Wolfsburg from Liverpool before the start of this season and has already scored seven goals for them.</p>
<p>Origi is a very talented young player and could be a future star for both Liverpool and Belgium. He will definitely be one to watch as the second half of the Bundesliga season progresses.</p>
