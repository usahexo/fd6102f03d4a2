#  Can Sevilla FC win the UEFA Europa League again this year?

The UEFA Europa League is a prestigious football competition that attracts some of the best teams from all over Europe. This year, Sevilla FC are one of the favourites to win the title, and they have the potential to go all the way.

Sevilla FC are a team that are capable of playing some very attacking football. They have some very talented players in their squad, including Wissam Ben Yedder, who has been in excellent form this season. The team’s captain, Sergio Escudero, is also a key player for them and he will be looking to inspire his team to victory.

The Spanish side have already won the UEFA Europa League twice in the past, and they will be looking to make it a third time this year. They have been in excellent form so far this season and they will be confident of beating any of their opponents in the competition.

However, they will face tough competition from teams such as RB Leipzig and Atlético Madrid, who are both capable of winning the title. It is going to be a very exciting competition and Sevilla FC definitely have a chance of winning it.

#  What do you think of the signing of Tomas Vaclik by Sevilla FC? 

Tomas Vaclik is a goalkeeper who has been playing for FC Basel since 2014. He has made over 100 appearances for the Swiss club and was their number one keeper. He has also represented the Czech Republic at international level.

On July 9, 2018, it was announced that Vaclik had signed for Sevilla FC on a four-year-deal. The transfer fee was reported to be in the region of €15 million.

I think this is a great signing by Sevilla FC. Vaclik is a very good goalkeeper and he will be a great addition to their squad. He has proven himself at FC Basel and he will now get the chance to play in La Liga. I am sure he will be a success at Sevilla and I look forward to seeing him in action.

#  Do you think Dominik Hasek is the best goalkeeper of all time? 

There are a lot of factors to consider when trying to answer this question. 

First and foremost, you would need to consider how many championships the goalie has won, as well as how many games they have played. 
Dominik Hasek has won six Vezina Trophies as the best goaltender in the NHL, and he was a part of two Stanley Cup championships with the Detroit Red Wings. He also holds the record for most shutouts in an NHL career with 72. In terms of games played, Hasek has racked up a total of 971 appearances during his career in the NHL. 

One could also make the case that Martin Brodeur is the best goaltender of all time. Brodeur is a four-time Vezina Trophy winner and he also holds the record for most wins by a goaltender in NHL history with 691. He was also part of three Stanley Cup championships with the New Jersey Devils. In terms of games played, Brodeur has appeared in 1,266 games – easily making him one of the most prolific goaltenders in NHL history. 

So who is really the best goalie of all time? It’s hard to say for sure, but you could certainly make a strong argument for either Dominik Hasek or Martin Brodeur.

#  How do you think HC Plzen will do in the upcoming Czech Hockey League season?

The HC Plzen is a Czech ice hockey club that was founded in 1911. The team has won the Czech championship nine times and has also won the Czech Cup six times. The HC Plzen plays its home games at the ALPI Arena in Plzen.

The offseason brought several changes to the HC Plzen roster. Forwards Radim Vrbata, Petr Straka, and Marek Langhamer all departed for other teams. In their place, the club signed forward Boris Sindelar and goaltender Vitek Vanecek.

The team will be looking to rebound from a disappointing 2017-2018 season in which they finished 8th out of 12 teams in the Czech Hockey League. The club was also knocked out of the Czech Cup in the quarterfinals.

In order to improve their chances this season, the HC Plzen brought in head coach Rostislav Vlach, who previously coached HC Litvinov and HC Karlovy Vary.

The preseason has been mixed for the club so far. They have a record of 3 wins and 3 losses, but have looked good in stretches.

They open up their season on September 15th against HC Liberec.
