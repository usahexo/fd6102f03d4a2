The Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut played host to the eight-time All-Star goalie and his teammates as they participated in a charity event.</p>
<p>The Dominik Hasek Foundation teamed up with the casino to benefit the Max Cure Foundation, which helps children with cancer and their families. </p>
<p>After the event, Hasek showed off his skills by playing blackjack and roulette. It was clear that he was having a good time at the tables; he even managed to win a few hands. </p>
<p>This isn’t Hasek’s first time at Foxwoods. He was there in 2016 for another charity event. And in 2017, he stopped by during an extended layover on his way back from playing goal for the Czech Republic in the Spengler Cup. </p>
<p>It seems that this legendary goalie enjoys spending time at Foxwoods Casino!</p>
<h1 id="Hasek-Thrills-Foxwoods-Casino-with-His-Magic"><a href="#Hasek-Thrills-Foxwoods-Casino-with-His-Magic" class="headerlink" title="Hasek Thrills Foxwoods Casino with His Magic"></a>Hasek Thrills Foxwoods Casino with His Magic</h1><p>FOXBOROUGH, MA - In a show of pure skill and magic, Tomas Hasek thrilled the Foxwoods Casino this past Saturday night. The audience was on the edge of their seats as the skilled magician performed his illusions right before their eyes.</p>
<p>From making a dove disappear to cutting a woman in two, Hasek had the audience captivated with his illusions. Many were left wondering how he did it, while others were just in amazement at his skills.</p>
<p>“It’s really amazing to see all of his tricks,” said one member of the audience. “He’s so talented.”</p>
<p>Hasek has been performing magic for over 25 years and has amazed audiences all over the world. His skills are sure to leave you wondering how he does it. If you’re looking for a truly unique experience, be sure to check out Hasek’s next performance. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
<h1 id="The-Great-Hasek-Delivers-at-Foxwoods-Casino"><a href="#The-Great-Hasek-Delivers-at-Foxwoods-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Great Hasek Delivers at Foxwoods Casino"></a>The Great Hasek Delivers at Foxwoods Casino</h1><p>The Tomas Hertl injury and the Pavelski line juggling that followed put the Sharks in a difficult position. Enter the Great Hasek.</p>
<p>The last time Tomas Hertl was in the lineup, the Sharks placed him on a line with Joe Pavelski and Joel Ward. The move seemed to be working as Hertl scored his second goal of the season against Vancouver on November 20th. However, on November 21st, Hertl awkwardly went into the boards and was seen leaving Rogers Arena on crutches. </p>
<p>Hertl’s absence left a hole in the Sharks lineup, which head coach Peter DeBoer attempted to fill by shuffling his lines. On December 1st, DeBoer moved Mikkel Boedker to the third line and put Joonas Donskoi on the top line with Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau. This incarnation of the top line lasted all of one game before DeBoer reverted back to Boedker on the top line and moved Donskoi to the second line with Logan Couture and Brent Burns. Finally, after three games of experimentation, DeBoer found a line combination that worked at Thursday’s practice when he reunited Thornton with Pavelski and Ward.</p>
<p>The fourth liners for San Jose were (or are) Chris Tierney, Matt Nieto, Tommy Wingels, Mike Brown and Melker Karlsson. It is unlikely that any of these players will see significant playing time barring injury or extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>Enter The Great Hasek. On Saturday night against Boston, goaltender Martin Jones was pulled after allowing four goals on 19 shots en route to an eventual 5-1 Bruins victory. Troy Grosenick replaced Jones in net but was not able to stop Boston from adding another goal resulting in a 6-1 loss for San Jose. This left head coach Peter DeBoer looking for a goaltender for Sunday’s game against the red-hot Detroit Red Wings. Petr Mrazek had already been announced as Jimmy Howard’s replacement due to Howard’s groin injury so there was no chance that he would be available for San Jose. This left DeBoer with two choices: dress Alex Stalock who has been out since December 3rd with an undisclosed injury or call up Niklas Svedberg from Worcester (AHL). DeBoer chose Svedberg who made his NHL debut at 23 years old yesterday afternoon against Detroit at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut . </p>
<p>Svedberg faced 26 shots throughout regulation and overtime and stopped 24 of them leading San Jose to a 3-2 shootout victory over Detroit. It is not often that you see an NHL debut result in a win let alone a shutout but Svedberg made history yesterday afternoon at Foxwoods Casino becoming just the second goalie in Sharks history to record a shutout in their first start (the other being Nolan Schaefer). </p>
<p>Prior to yesterday’s game, Niklas Svedberg had never played an NHL game nor had he ever faced more than 26 shots in any single game at any level of hockey he had played professionally which includes games in both Sweden’s Elitserien (SHL) as well as Finland’s Liiga . </p>
<p>When asked about his thoughts on starting Svedberg instead of Alex Stalock , head coach Peter DeBoer stated:<br>“I just thought it was time to give him [Svedberg] a look,” said DeBoer of his decision to go with the rookie netminder . “He’s earned it . He’s been great down there [in Worcester] .”<br>That decision paid off as Svedberg led San Jose to an improbable victory over Detroit stopping 24 out of 26 shots faced including all three shootout attempts he faced . </p>
<p>It is amazing what can happen when you give someone an opportunity; especially when they have earned it . That is what happened yesterday afternoon when Niklas Svedberg was given his first opportunity at NHL action and he excelled leading San Jose to a 3-2 shootout victory over Detroit .</p>
<h1 id="Hasek-Amazes-at-Foxwoods-Casino"><a href="#Hasek-Amazes-at-Foxwoods-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Hasek Amazes at Foxwoods Casino"></a>Hasek Amazes at Foxwoods Casino</h1><p>Miroslav Hasek, better known to the poker world as “Czechmate”, put on a clinic at Foxwoods Casino this past weekend. Amassing an incredible $181,000 in prize money, Hasek was seemingly unstoppable. </p>
<p>A regular on the tournament scene, Hasek has had some notable cashes in his career, but nothing compared to this past weekend. His closest previous finish was a 2nd place finish in a €1,100 event in Prague last year for $27,500. </p>
<p>The final table of the Foxwoods Casino event was stacked with talent, including John “The Governor” D’Agostino and Sammy “The Scorpion” Farha. But it was Hasek who would come out on top, defeating Farha heads-up to take home the title and the bulk of the prize money. </p>
<p>Hasek’s victory is all the more impressive when you consider that he only entered the event as a last-minute replacement for an injured player. With no time to prepare or practice for the event, Hasek showed that he is one of the best in the business when it comes to big buy-in tournaments. </p>
<p>Foxwoods Casino is quickly becoming a hotspot for high-stakes poker players, with big events like this one regularly drawing some of the top talent in the world. If you want to see some of the best players in action, be sure to check out upcoming events at Foxwoods Casino – you won’t be disappointed.</p>
<h1 id="Hasek-Wows-Foxwoods-Casino-with-His-Skills"><a href="#Hasek-Wows-Foxwoods-Casino-with-His-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Hasek Wows Foxwoods Casino with His Skills"></a>Hasek Wows Foxwoods Casino with His Skills</h1><p>The Czech Republic goalie, Dominik Hasek, made an impressive showing at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut this past weekend. He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in 1983 and played for six teams over his illustrious career. Hasek is considered one of the greatest goaltenders in the history of the National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
<p>In exhibition games against casino guests on Saturday and Sunday, Hasek showcased his incredible skills between the pipes. He made 54 saves over two days, allowing only two goals against. His reflexes and agile moves amazed onlookers and left them wondering how he ever let any puck past him.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the first time that Hasek has wowed crowds with his netminding prowess. He won two Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings and was twice voted as the NHL’s best goaltender. In addition, he was nominated for eight Vezina Trophies (the award given to the league’s top goalie) and six Hart Memorial Trophies (awarded to the player deemed most valuable to his team).</p>
<p>At 52 years old, Hasek is still going strong and showing younger goalies how it’s done. If you ever have a chance to see him play in person, be sure to take it! You won’t be disappointed.</p>
