        <h1 id="Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Over-100-Rooms"><a href="#Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Over-100-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Over 100 Rooms"></a>Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Over 100 Rooms</h1><p>The Red Rock Casino Resort in Las Vegas is expanding its property by adding over 100 rooms. This will bring the resort’s total number of rooms to more than 1,000, making it one of the largest on the Strip. The expansion is set to open in late 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to the new rooms, the expansion will also include a 50,000-square-foot casino and a new restaurant. It will be built on a five-acre plot that was formerly home to the Riviera casino.</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino Resort has been owned by Station Casinos Inc. since 2007. The company plans to spend $375 million on the expansion project.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Bitcoin-Casino"><a href="#Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Bitcoin-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Bitcoin Casino"></a>Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Bitcoin Casino</h1><p>Las Vegas-based Red Rock Casino Resort has announced it will soon be adding a Bitcoin casino to its list of offerings. The new casino will allow players to use the popular cryptocurrency to gamble on games of chance.</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino Resort is no stranger to innovation, having been one of the first casinos in Las Vegas to offer a mobile gaming app. The addition of the Bitcoin casino is in line with the company’s goal of providing guests with the most cutting-edge gaming experience possible.</p>
<p>Guests at the new Bitcoin casino will be able to gamble on a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. In addition, they will have access to a number of exclusive Bitcoin-only games that cannot be found at other casinos.</p>
<p>Management at Red Rock Casino Resort believes that the addition of a Bitcoin casino will be incredibly popular with guests. They are expecting heavy traffic from players who want to take advantage of the anonymity and security that Bitcoin provides.</p>
<p>In addition, management believes that the Bitcoin casino will be a great way to draw in new guests who may not have previously considered playing at the resort. With cryptocurrency becoming more and more popular, there is sure to be a lot of interest in Red Rock’s new offering.</p>
<h1 id="Expansion-at-Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Another-200-Rooms"><a href="#Expansion-at-Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Adds-Another-200-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Expansion at Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Another 200 Rooms"></a>Expansion at Red Rock Casino Resort Adds Another 200 Rooms</h1><p>Construction crews are putting the finishing touches on the new expansion at Red Rock Casino Resort. The 200-room project is adding significantly more space to the property, which is already one of the largest in Nevada.</p>
<p>The expansion includes a new pool area, a high-end spa, and multiple restaurants and bars. It also includes a 35,000-square-foot convention center that can accommodate up to 1,500 people. The project has been in the works for several years and is finally coming to fruition.</p>
<p>The expansion is expected to be completed in early 2019. In the meantime, the casino is already busy taking bookings for events at the new convention center.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Grows-Again-with-100-New-Rooms"><a href="#Red-Rock-Casino-Resort-Grows-Again-with-100-New-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Red Rock Casino Resort Grows Again with 100 New Rooms"></a>Red Rock Casino Resort Grows Again with 100 New Rooms</h1><p>Just in time for summer fun, Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa is getting bigger. The popular resort is expanding by 100 new rooms, making it one of the largest on the Las Vegas Strip. </p>
<p>The new rooms are part of a $50 million renovation project that will also include a new pool area, upgraded food and beverage venues, and a new state-of-the-art concert venue. The expansion is expected to be completed in time for Memorial Day weekend. </p>
<p>“We are excited about this next phase of our property enhancements that continue to elevate the guest experience at Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa,” said Jason Gomes, senior vice president and general manager of Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa. “The additional rooms combined with our updated amenities will provide guests with even more options when choosing where to stay and play in Las Vegas.” </p>
<p>Red Rock’s gaming floor will also be expanding as part of the renovation project. A new race and sports book viewing area, complete with VIP seating and bartending service, will be added. In addition, several new slot machines and table games will be installed throughout the casino floor. </p>
<p>The resort is already popular among tourists and locals alike, but these updates are sure to make it an even more desirable destination for everyone looking for a great time in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Bitcoing-Casinos-Booming-Red-Rock-Adds-Gaming-Floor"><a href="#Bitcoing-Casinos-Booming-Red-Rock-Adds-Gaming-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoing Casinos Booming: Red Rock Adds Gaming Floor"></a>Bitcoing Casinos Booming: Red Rock Adds Gaming Floor</h1><p>The popularity of bitcoing casinos is on the rise, with the latest development coming from Red Rock Resort in Las Vegas. The property has officially opened its new 27,000-square-foot bitcoin gaming floor, complete with a bookmaker and a race and sports book.</p>
<p>According to operators, the move is in response to increased demand from customers who want to gamble with bitcoin. In addition to traditional casino games, the new gaming floor will offer a variety of wagers on esports matches, as well as a range of other digital currency options.</p>
<p>“There’s a big market for this and we feel we are offering something unique,” said Red Rock president Brian Greenspan.</p>
<p>Bitcoing casinos have been growing in popularity for a number of reasons. For one thing, they offer quick and easy transactions, with no need to provide personal information or undergo identity verification. What’s more, many players feel that bitcoing offers greater security and privacy than traditional banking methods.</p>
<p>It’s not just smaller operations that are benefiting from the trend; big names like BitStarz and FortuneJack have also seen increased interest in their gaming platforms. In a recent interview, BitStarz marketing manager Jelena Rozanova noted that “the market is growing at an alarming rate,” with over 250% growth in the past 12 months alone.</p>
<p>This growth is likely to continue in light of escalating global tensions around data security and privacy. As consumers become increasingly aware of the risks associated with traditional payment methods, bitcoing is seen as a more reliable option. And with more and more casinos opening their doors to digital currency transactions, it looks like this trend is here to stay.</p>
